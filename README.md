During my internship at Oasis Infobyte, I had the privilege of being part of their Data Science fellowship program. The internship was designed to provide a valuable learning experience, focusing on acquiring new skills and gaining a deeper understanding of key concepts in the field. I was given the opportunity to apply my knowledge hands-on, which allowed me to further develop my practical skills.
I was given meaningful tasks and responsibilities, and I was encouraged to perform them to the best of my ability. Which enables me to explore various aspects of Data Science and apply my knowledge to real-world projects.
